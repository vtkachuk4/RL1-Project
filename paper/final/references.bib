  abstract  = {We study the link between generalization and interference in temporal-difference (TD) learning. Interference is defined as the inner product of two different gradients, representing their alignment; this quantity emerges as being of interest from a variety of observations about neural networks, parameter sharing and the dynamics of learning. We find that TD easily leads to low-interference, under-generalizing parameters, while the effect seems reversed in supervised learning. We hypothesize that the cause can be traced back to the interplay between the dynamics of interference and bootstrapping. This is supported empirically by several observations: the negative relationship between the generalization gap and interference in TD, the negative effect of bootstrapping on interference and the local coherence of targets, and the contrast between the propagation rate of information in TD(0) versus TD($\lambda$) and regression tasks such as Monte-Carlo policy evaluation. We hope that these new findings can guide the future discovery of better bootstrapping methods.}

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful abstraction of sequential decision making that has an established theoretical foundation and has proven effective in a variety of small, simulated domains. The success of RL on real-world problems with large, often continuous state and action spaces hinges on effective function approximation. Of the many function approximation schemes proposed, tile coding strikes an empirically successful balance among representational power, computational cost, and ease of use and has been widely adopted in recent RL work. This paper demonstrates that the performance of tile coding is quite sensitive to parameterization. We present detailed experiments that isolate the effects of parameter choices and provide guidance to their setting. We further illustrate that no single parameterization achieves the best performance throughout the learning curve, and contribute an automated technique for adjusting tile-coding parameters online. Our experimental findings confirm the superiority of adaptive parameterization to fixed settings. This work aims to automate the choice of approximation scheme not only on a problem basis but also throughout the learning process, eliminating the need for a substantial tuning effort.},
